# Fourier Series Visualization

A tool to help visualize Fourier series in JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

My variation of Fourier Series from The Coding Train: ["Coding Challenge #125: Fourier Series"](https://youtu.be/Mm2eYfj0SgA) 

I added sliders for speed and N, and the bottons to see sawtooth wave and triangle wave.
