# Japanese Youtuber Sound Effects 

I tried to make a tool to play with sounds effects in JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

You can choose bgm or sounds effect by clicking two buttons bellow with mark of musicical notes.

In order to play with this, you need to make 2 directories for bgm and sounds effect. 

I prepared "bgm" and "sounds" directories including 10 mp3 files: "0~9.mp3" in each folders.
